# meeus
I am curious about astronomy, and, these days, Fortran;
and its interop with C, Python.

The inspiration for the library is taken from
"Astronomical Algorithms" by Jean Meeus.

The API is unstable. Likely I will run out of steam Real Soon (TM).

To install Python bindings:

```
pip install python/.
```
